# Final-Python-Project
Project Overview
The Employee Management System is a Python-based command-line application designed to manage employee records efficiently. This system allows users to perform essential operations such as adding, updating, searching, and deleting employee details, as well as listing all employees in the system. The project demonstrates the use of core Python concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data validation, and file handling.

### Features
#### 1. Add Employee:
  Allows users to enter employee details (ID, Name, Position, Salary, and Email) while validating inputs such as unique IDs and proper email formats.
#### 2. Update Employee by ID:
  Enables updating specific fields (Name, Position, Salary, or Email) or all details for an existing employee.
#### 3. Delete Employee by ID:
  Removes an employee's record based on their unique ID.
#### 4. Search Employee by ID:
  Retrieves and displays details of an employee by their unique ID.
#### 5. List All Employees:
  Displays all employees with their details in a user-friendly format.
#### 6. Input Validation:
  Ensures data integrity by validating employee IDs and email formats.
  
### Technologies Used
#### 1. Python
  ##### OOP Principles: Classes and methods to encapsulate employee-related data and operations.
  ##### File Handling (optional): Persistent storage using CSV files can be integrated.
  ##### Data Validation: Email format checks and unique ID validation.

### Future Enhancements
#### 1. Add persistent storage using a CSV or database to save employee records across program runs.
#### 2. Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
#### 3. Add more advanced data validation (e.g., regex-based salary validation, more robust email checks).
#### 4. Include role-based authentication for multi-user access control.
